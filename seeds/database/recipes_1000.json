All we had for a long time was the list of ingredients on the back of an old envelope.  We lost it for a good while and after I found it, I originally posted it so I would never lose it again.   Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the 'lost' phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost. Hey, it is a PIE, it is SUPPOSED to be sweet.  Enjoy",

I cook this in the microwave, but I'm sure you could do it on the stove too. Times are what work in my microwave. Please use your own good judgment on times to use in your microwave. (In my quest to eat healthier, I now make it with light butter, light cream and reduced fat Parmesan cheese. It still tastes wonderful, but there isn't any guilt!)\nPLEASE NOTE! This is an 'authentic' Alfredo sauce recipe! Real Alfredo sauce *only* contains butter, cream, Parmesan cheese and pepper. It will be thin and there is no garlic in it! If you want a thicker sauce or one with garlic like modern restaurants serve, please look elsewhere! Recipe #52892 and Recipe #8596 are two good places to start.",

Saute onions in 2 Tbsp oil  and 2 Tbsp butter, over moderate heat, until they are soft and lightly colored  (about 8 minutes). Add mush- rooms and saute. Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste,  wine, parsley, seasonings and sugar., Reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered,  for 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, and the mixture is quite thick. Remove skillet from heat and let it  cool completely., Start seasoning the eggplants: peel eggplants and slice vertically, 1/8 to 1/4  inch thick. Sprinkle lightly with salt and let sit for 30 minutes., Now make the  Bechamel Sauce.  NOTE:  The Bechamel-egg-ricotta mixture will overflow all but the largest  (professional size) food processors. Use a mixer or blend by hand.Place the milk in a saucepan, and heat it just until tiny  bubbles appear along the edges. Remove and set aside., Melt the butter in 3-quart saucepan over very low heat until foamy, being careful not to brown. Slowly add the 6 Tbsp flour, stirring constantly until smooth (3-4 minutes), and  still being careful not to let it brown., Add the milk slowly, whipping with a wire whisk. When the mixture is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat and stir in seasonings., Stir ricotta cheese until it is smooth  and creamy. Gently fold it into the Bechamel sauce. Stir in beaten eggs until  thoroughly incorporated., Back to the eggplant: Rinse well with cold water; squeeze gently and pat dry. Dredge the eggplant in 1 1/2 cups flour, and saute each in olive oil until it is  brown on both sides., Remove and discard any excess oil that has risen to the  top of the tomato mixture. Lightly grease a 16x10 baking pan that is at least 3  inches deep, and sprinkle the bottom with a few breadcrumbs., Place a layer of  eggplant in the pan, following with a layer of tomato mixture. Sprinkle with  breadcrumbs and grated cheese. Repeat as many times as you have eggplant to  last. Pour the Bechamel-ricotta sauce over the top and bake at 300 deg. F for  one hour, or until a golden-brown crust has formed on top., Remove moussaka from  oven and let it stand undisturbed 20-30 minutes; the delay allows the layers to  fuse., ]"

I didn't leave enough room between the cookies in the first batch and they ran into each other when baking. They still taste good. The original poster describes below where she got the recipe.\n\nThe Lemon Lovers Cookbook The Chicago Sun-Times  Peg Bailey has a passion for lemons. Having lived  all over the world, Bailey is able to cull the best national dishes  from places such as Greece, Malta,  England, and her home in Virginia for The  Lemon Lovers Cookbook. The recipes  are never overly complicated, and most  are ideal for weekday cooking. Exotic  fare such as Aegean shrimp and  caviar mousse exist peacefully with all-American staples such as  carrot cake and lemon bars.   Easy Refrigerator Lemon Cookies  These cookies are great in the summer with a  bowl of fresh fruit. Plan ahead,  though, as you have to leave the dough in  the refrigerator for several hours  before baking.",

Add sugar gradually and continue whipping until it is thoroughly mixed inches., NEVER add eggs directly to a hot mixture. (unless you like scrambled eggs in cream.)  Pour some of the hot liquid into the eggs while stirring briskly, then  return the warmed combination to the remaining hot liquid in the pan., Stir the custard constantly over low heat until it acquires body.   Test it  by letting it run off the back of a spoon; if a light coating clings to the  spoon, the custard is finished., Stir the custard occasionally as it cools to prevent a surface skin from  forming.

I always use a yogurt container to  measure it but you could use a bucket if you've a large group for which to  cater.",

Meanwhile combine the rest of the  ingredients and beat to form a batter of the consistency of double cream., If  you wish you can add mixed dried herbs to add a savoury flavour., When the fat  is smoking take the tin out of the oven and place it over a low light so that it doesn't cool as you add the batter., Pour in the batter If you're using muffin  tins don't over fill., Remember that the puddings will rise and puff up., Put  the tin back into the top of the oven as soon as possible and leave for about  20-25 minutes by which time they will be puffed up and crisp., When my  grandmother used to make Yorkshire pudding to go with the Sunday  roast we would eat it in the true Yorkshire way., That is, as a first course with just a  savoury gravy poured over it.  After all, the idea of Yorkshire pudding is to  fill you up so that you don't want so much of the more expensive meat!  If there was any of the pudding left over as a treat we  kids would have it as a desert  with Golden Syrup poured over it. Servings: 4 Ian Rice (Yorkshireman)]"

I think it would be better with twice as much garlic. I boiled my zucchini slices for about 3 minutes so they were partially cooked. I wanted to make sure they were soft in the finished dish or I knew the kids wouldn't eat them. ;) The cottage cheese provides a slightly tangy note. I think we would have preferred ricotta, but that is personal taste. I use my 11x7 baking dish and got 6 pieces the size of what you see in my photos. Both of the guys ate two so it fed 4 of us, and I double the meat. Adjust the recipe accordingly for your family.",

Season lightly with salt and the red hot pepper to taste. Stir to blend the flavours and bring slowly to the boil., Throw the pasta into the puree and cook until firm, diluting with a little of the bean cooking water, but only if necessary - the soup must be thick and rather solid., It is excellent hot, but is absolutely delicious if heated up with the addition of a drop of first-rate olive oil., If you prefer, leave a few beans whole and add them to the saucepan with the puree. Some cooks hold that a carrot is not out of place in the mirepoix (but then cut out the bacon), or that the soup loses nothing if you add a little tomato, even tomato concentrate (paste).]"

The prodecure for making any herbal vinegar is the same, no matter what herb or combination of herbs you are using. All you need are some herbs, top quality vinegars, glass jars and a glass or stainless steel saucepan.\nFor the best retention of flavors, store flavored vinegars in the refrigerator or a cool dark place. If properly prepared, flavored vinegars should retain good quality for two to three months in cool room storage and for six to eight months in refrigerated storage. \n-=Attention=-\nShould you decided to display pretty bottles of herb and fruit vinegars on a kitchen window sill. If left out for more than a few weeks, these bottles are then considered as decoration and not used in food preparation.",

Here is what the original poster said about this recipe: 'You can take one of two approaches for the top crust here - a lattice top is more traditional and a little more work - the dough can be a little crumbly so you need to add a little water to roll it out.  You can skip the lattice and simply crumble the top crust dough over the jam and bake.  It will look more like a cobbler.  Either way will taste just fine!'",

I consider this 'perfect' chocolate cake. This cake is excellent with  both with Recipe #261024 and Recipe #208959 (the dark flavor version). (I use Recipe #95416 when I'm decorating the cake.) I love how the leftovers are still moist even a day or two later. (I store my loosely covered with plastic wrap.)\nMy father adores this cake with Recipe #261024 on it. For his birthday, Father's Day etc. I make him cupcakes with the icing on them and individually wrap them. He keeps them in his freezer for when he wants 'a piece of cake'. He claims they are as good as when they are fresh. \n(Even though it isn't where I got the recipe from so I can't vouch for it, reviewers have said it is the recipe on the Hershey's cocoa can. I would recommend using their Special Dark Cocoa if possible.)",

NOTE: I have tried it with 1/2 cup, 2/3 cup and 3/4 cup boiling water and we prefer it with less than 1 cup water. I usually use between 2/3 & 3/4 cups. The cake is still very moist but it doesn't seem to \"fall\" as much as it cools. This might have to do with our high humidity or brand of flour or other factors so I don't know if it will work for everyone., Pour into prepared pan., Bake 30 to 35 minutes for round 9-inch pans, 35 to 40 minutes for rectangular pan or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. (Do not use 8-inch pans or the batter will overflow.)., Because they have a tendency to overflow if you fill them more than 2/3 full, I usually get about 27-28 cupcakes per batch. Bake for approximately 18-20 minutes., Cool 10 minutes; remove from pan to wire racks., Please note: baking cocoa isn't hot chocolate drink mix! Baking cocoa contains no sugar and it is found on the baking aisle. Chocolate drink mixes that you add to milk or water to drink WILL NOT work in this recipe.]"

Make sure the beef is in a large frying pan, and drain the fat. When the sausage is done, pat it dry with paper towels to remove the grease.  When the beef is just about done, grind the pepper over the beef, probably about 1 Tbsp worth., Add about 1/2 to 1 Tbsp soy sauce and mix it in to  the beef., You can replace the soy sauce with salt, but it adds a nice zing to the flavor., At this point, I usually cut the onion into chunks and throw it into my Cuisinart with the garlic, and shred them to bits, and toss them in ., But sliced into small bits works well also., Add the onion and garlic, and let cook down (covered) until the onion gets a little clear., I add a little oil here sometimes, depending on how much fat was in the meat. Add the tomato paste, and mix it in ., I do the paste first because it makes it faster and easier to get the consistency right when the sauce comes in ., Add the sauce and mix it well., Add generous amounts of the oregano and Italian Seasoning., Don't go overboard on the basil though., Add the bay leaves., Let it simmer., Mix it, and let it simmer longer., Start the water boiling for the ziti., Add some salt and oil to the water to make it boil quicker, and to help keep the zitis from sticking., Throw the green pepper, sausage, and mushrooms into the sauce. Next stir about 4 or 5 Tbsp Parmesan cheese in to the sauce. When the ziti is done, drain them and dump into a large rectangular Pyrex., I don't remember the exact size, but I think its around 9x18., You may have a touch too many zitis, but they are delicious plain, so eat any extras., Once the Parmesan has melted into the sauce and made it stringy, and the sauce has thickened, stir the sauce into the zitis., Mix it all well., Now, lay the sliced mozzarella over the ziti like shingles on a roof., Sprinkle over some more Parmesan, maybe a tablespoons., Bake at 350°F for 45 minutes to 1 hour.]"

Please use the ingredient amounts in parentheses to increase the yield by about 50%.\nIn response to the one-star review: Yes, it *was* originally called German's Chocolate Cake but most of the mixes, recipes and ads for selling a cake like this, that I see, call it 'German Chocolate Cake'.

      "Description": "This marvelous recipe is one I got off this newsgroup some months back, but am reposting for the Alfredo request since I have no idea if the original poster is still around to see the new request. Since it isn't mine, I've also included the original poster's notes and attribution. Yummy stuff!  Introduction: This is the real thing. You will not find a better Fettuccine Alfredo other than at Alfredo's in Rome, Italy. The secret to his sauce is in the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese (don't even try this recipe without it), the balance of the pepper and nutmeg. For some reason restaurants never get it right. Be warned that the sauce is heavy. This recipe serves 2. Recipe by Ricardo Batista   Fettuccine Alfredo",

Chili, to an aficionado, is more than a spicy stew; it is a  craving, a passion, for a simmered combination of meat and chile peppers  that warms the heart and inspires the soul.    The exact origin of chili is still shrouded in mystery. Some people believe it  wa  s originated by chuckwagon cooks who regularly prepared stew for the cowpokes  of the Southwest. Possibly, one of the these cooks ran out of black pepper and  in his search for a substitute, he came across some red chile peppers which were  common among the Indians and Mexicans in the territory that is now west Texas.  These undomesticated capsicums were extremely hot. When the cowboys inquired  about the source of the extreme heat, they were told that the heat came from the  'chile', or hot pepper. Over time, this sizzling stew became popular in its own  right, and became known as 'chili'.",

Preheat oven to 350°F, In a large bowl combine sugars; butter-beat until fluffy., Add pumpkin, vanilla and the egg; blend well., Add flour, baking powder and soda, and all spices; mix  well., If you have chosen to add nuts, add and stir., As for the  cooking you can do this one of 2 ways., The first way if you like tiny little  cookies (HAH! Not me! but some like 'em  bite size) then you would drop them  by rounded teaspoonfuls about 2 inches  apart onto a parchment-lined cookie  sheet. Bake these small ones at 350°F for 10-12 minutes., DON'T FORGET TO PREHEAT  THE OVEN FIRST! Duh   many of us forget that sometimes.um.ok. I admit it has  happened before).  Now for those of us who adore larger cookies (OH JOY!) then drop by hefty  tablespoonfuls about 3 inches apart on a parchment-lined cookie sheet.  Bake at 350°F for 11-13 minutes., Secret: Always use cookie sheets with no lips or edges., Get a really good  quality sheet--its worth it! Wilton's is very good., (I use an insulated  sheet, and I just tried the Silverstone baking liners for the first time.  Good idea!) Also, let sheets cool to room temp before second batch., (Or use  freezer to cool sheets faster). Or just use 2 sheets and alternate.)  The cookies won't look done really but as they sit they solidify   They  are really cakey., As an added treat you can whip up some cream cheese  frosting as a dip, if if you don't mind them messier just squeeze a couple  lines over finished cookies., Pure delight!  from: Ann and .topsecretrecipes.com.]"

      "Description": "This is the traditional birthday cake in my brother's house. I ALWAYS look forward to having it again. It is moist, rich and decadent! If you use chunky peanut butter in the Frosting, omit the chopped peanuts. \n\nPLEASE NOTE, this is a recipe that you really need to make BOTH the cake and the frosting to appreciate. It is the combination that makes it so good. If you are looking for JUST a chocolate cake recipe, you should try Recipe #2496, not this one. ;)",

They are wafers that you melt to then dip candies into to coat them. They are usually sold in the candy section of craft or baking stores. I've seen them in the candy making section of Wal-Mart also. If you look at the ingredients photo on Recipe #104941, you'll see a photo of them. They are a different 'stiffness' than white chocolate chips but some reviews have successfully used those when they can't find the candy coating. Hope that helps!",

If you are having trouble with it 'setting up', you probably didn't cook it long enough. I have learned (the hard way!) to not trust my candy thermometer and to use to soft ball stage water test to make sure it is the right temperature. Even under cooking it by 2-3&deg; will result in a soft, sticky mess. It still taste good though. :)\nSome good suggestions from reviewers: (I highly recommend reading through all the reviews before making this fudge!)\n- don't try to bring up temp too quickly\n- a large shallow saucepan works better than a deeper one",

Be sure to beat the eggs until they reach this temperature at  which salmonella bacteria is killed. This will take about 10 to 15 minutes.  Be sure to move the beater around the bowl so the eggs cook evenly; there will be quite a bit of spattering., TO SERVE THE ZABAGLIONE: Transfer the mixture to wine glasses and serve immediately accompanied by ladyfingers or Italian cookies known as \"Savoiardi.\", An alternative way to serve this is to take slices of pound cake or panettone and set them on a broiler pan. Cover the cake slices with a  layer of sliced strawberries or peeled Comice pear, and ladle a portion of the zabaglione over the fruit. Broil the slices for a minute or until the zabaglione is bubbling and lightly browned., Serve immediately.]"

When you've finished with the dough, b ake the biscuits in a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes, just until they start to brown, then take them out and preheat the broiler, and then stick the biscuits back in until they are brown., You can brush them with melted butter if you like.

For eggplants, slice them, salt them a bit and let them set until they begin to \"weep,\" then squeeze out as much moisture as you can.), Dry the pieces off and toss them with oil or melted butter (just a LITTLE oil or butter--part of the beauty of this dish is that it's fairly light)., Lay them out on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake in a 375F oven for around 20-30 minutes, or until everything starts to look slightly browner than when you put it in., Arrange the vegetables on a plate and sprinkle with whatever condiments you like (or have around)., Note 1: You can roast a piece of fish or chicken (or marinated tofu) on the baking sheet with the vegetables. It makes a nice little dinner. Not much clean-up effort either, Note 2: This method also works with some fruits--apples, pears, pineapple, stone fruits, figs, bananas, etc. Use butter and sprinkle on a bit of sugar, honey and/or vanilla. Serve plain or with ice, sour or whipped cream]"

Prep time does not include the time it takes to pit the cherries or make the pie crust. ;) I use the Pie Crust recipe in the Fanny Farmer Baking Book. Recipe #13619 is the recipe for 2 8-inch crust. (I've found I have to refrigerate it for the pie filling to firm up and not be 'soupy' when it has cooled. Once it has completely chilled, you can store it at room temperature and it doesn't lose its firmness. Or, store it in the fridge and warm it in the microwave a little bit before serving it with ice cream or whipped cream if desired.)",

      "Description": "A fantastic fudge recipe. It is easier to make than the cooked varieties that require a candy thermometer, but it sets up better than some of the other recipes I've tried that use marshmallows or marshmallow cream. The best of both worlds!! I rich, dense fudge that's fairly simple to prepare. NOTE: I prefer to use dark chocolate chips for a richer, fudgier taste. See the bottom of the instructions for variations.",

Sprinkle with salt to taste. If you're using fresh rosemary, just insert the sprigs with the garlic slivers into the cuts you made., Place lamb, fat side up on a rack in an uncovered pan., Roast  30 minutes to a pound or  until the internal temperature reaches 175-180°F, for meat well done. If you prefer  slightly rare lamb, roast until 160-165°F., When done, remove from oven, cover the roast in foil and allow it to rest for 20 minutes before carving., If you also want delicious rich gravy, place a 1 1/2 cups of lamb or beef stock in the bottom of the pan before you put the lamb in the oven, making sure that the rack sits above the liquid and the meat doesn't touch it. You can also add a sprig or two of rosemary to it and if you want baste the lamb a couple of times while it's roasting. Just before serving bring the liquid to a simmer on the stove top, making sure you whisk it well and scrape all the bits from the sides and the bottom of the pan. If you want more gravy you can add some extra stock or some of the water you have cooked your vegetables inches Mix 1tbsp of cornflour with 2tbsp of water and whisk it into the stock. Simmer until thickened and you have a wonderful gravy.]"

      "RecipeInstructions": "[Sauce procedure: Cut whole chicken into it's constituent parts (breasts, thigh, etc.) and remove skin.  Remove skin from thighs. (trim fat deposits and rinse all chicken thoroughly) This step is critical., Cut all chicken pieces in half.  This exposes the crucial bone marrow. The more marrow you expose, the better the sauce. I chop the wings into 4 or five pieces. Do not add giblets and neck., In large pot, combine chicken, salt, Paprika, chicken base, and  enough water to just cover the chicken pieces., Cook, partially covered, at such temperature that a simmer to very gentle boil is achieved. You want just a bit of bubbling., Do so until the chicken is thoroughly cooked and easily removed from the bone--About  1.5 hrs. (I cook the chicken until it is on the verge of falling off the bone.  This extracts maximum flavor from the chicken.), Strain mixture to separate liquid and chicken.  Place chicken into a warm serving dish., Return liquid to pot, and vigorously mix in sour cream and milk. I use a whisk for this. Carefully bring the sauce to a boil and remove immediately from heat. Failure to remove promptly will result in very messy boiling over!, Set burner to it's lowest setting and return pot to the burner to keep sauce hot.  The sauce is basically finished at this point.  You may wish to fine tune by adding more salt, sour cream, Paprika, and/or chicken base. I sometimes add a 1/2 cup or so of heavy cream for added richness. You may also want to skim most of the liquid fat from the sauce surface., Noodles procedure: Combine flour, salt, and eggs in a hemispherical bowl large enough to accommodate mixing., Add about 1/2 cup water and proceed to blend ingredients with a fork until well blended. The consistency your striving for is such that the dough is clearly wet, adheres to the bowl, and is loose enough to slowly spread out when a dollop is applied to the cutting board. Add enough water to achieve this. I've never measured how much water I use, but think it's about 1/2 cup plus some.  Actually, the consistency is not critical. I'm guessing you've made noodles (or dumplings) like this, and that additional, excruciating explanation is not necessary., Set a Dutch oven (good size pot) 2/3 full of water to boil. At this point, obviously the dough goes into the water. I place a good size dollop on a small cutting board and use a gently curved, sharp knife to cut perhaps 1/2\" size blobs which are then vigorously swept off the board into the boiling water., They are done when they float to the surface. A perforated spoon is used to remove the noodles from the water which are placed in a warm serving bowl., I cut perhaps 3-4 dozen noodles, let them cook (very quick), remove, and proceed to add the next 3-4 dozen until all of the dough is consumed. If it looks like boiling over is about to occur, add some cold water., Finally: At this point you should have a pot of wonderful sauce, a bowl full of chicken pieces, and a bowl of noodles. For serving, place a good serving of noodles and half  (maybe less) as much chicken into a flat bowl. Apply enough sauce to almost cover noodles and chicken., You may want to salt to taste. My wife likes pepper on it. I do not. In any case, Viola!    That's it. I really want you to try this, as everyone on both sides of our family loves it. My instructions are laborious because attention paid to various details will produce a superb dish, while an average effort with average ingredients  produce a result that is only very good.]"

After I cook & drain the broccoli, I place it in the casserole dish while I use the same pan to make the sauce. I then pour the broccoli back into the pan to coat it and return it all to the casserole dish. Rinse the saucepan out, it doesn't need to be 'clean' just rinsed, and then use the same pan to make the melted butter and bread crumb mixture. If you use the microwave to cook your broccoli, just use the casserole dish to cook it in. Hope that helps!",

The first time I tried it, I knew it was something that I had to share with you. I use those Spanish green olives that are stuffed with pimentos, because it adds some nice color.Since the recipe calls for diced, I save a little money by using the ones that come sliced in the jar because they are made from olives that are not perfect enough to be sold whole",

Here's what the original poster said about these bars:\n\n\"These aren't difficult to make, but they look fancy because they  have three distinct layers.  A shortbread crust is topped by a  chocolate layer, which is then topped with a thin walnut layer. The bars freeze well, and they'll keep for several days at room temperature if stored airtight.  I've even mailed these successfully, wrapping them in pairs with the bottoms together and packaging them in a sturdy, well-padded carton before placing them in a similarly sturdy, well-padded box.  The most important thing to remember about these bars is that the chocolate layer needs some time to set up, even after the bars have cooled to room temperature.  I usually make the bars the night before I'm going to cut and serve them, but chilling the bars after they've cooled for about 20 minutes should have the same effect.\"",

Bake 20 to 25 minutes., When done, top of walnut layer will be a light golden brown; edges will be darker.  Remove to cooling rack., Cool completely before storing airtight., Before cutting, see  Notes at beginning of recipe.  To cut, use a large, sharp, straight- edged knife.  Trim about 1/4 inch from each edge before cutting into bars., Store bars airtight at room temperature for up to several days, or freezer for longer storage.]"

Or grease and flour a fluted tube pan., Lightly combine the milk, eggs, and vanilla in a medium-size bowl., In a large mixing bowl, combine the cake flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Add the lemon zest and poppy seeds., Mix on low speed for 30 seconds to blend., Then add the butter and half the egg  mixture.  Mix on low speed until the dry ingredients are moistened., Increase  the speed to medium (high if you are using a hand mixer), and beat for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl., Gradually add the remaining egg mixture in two batches, beating for 20 seconds after each addition, and scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary., Spoon the batter into the prepared pan, and smooth the surface with a spatula.  The batter will be almost 1/2 inch from the top of a 4-cup loaf pan., Bake, covering the pan loosely with buttered aluminum foil after 30 minutes to prevent over browning, until a toothpick inserted into  the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes (35 to 45 minutes in a fluted pan). To get an attractive split down the middle of the crust, wait until the natural  split is about to develop (when cake has cooked for about 20 minutes), and then  use a lightly greased sharp knife to make a shallow mark about 6 inches long  down the middle of the cake. (This must be done very quickly so that the oven  door does not remain open very long, or the cake will fall).  When the cake splits, it will open along the mark., Shortly before the cake is done, prepare  the Lemon Syrup: In a small pan over medium heat, stir the sugar and lemon juice together until the sugar has dissolved., As soon as the cake comes out of the oven, place the pan on a wire rack, poke the cake all over with a wire tester or wooden skewer, and brush it with half the syrup., Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes., Loosen the sides of the cake with a spatula, and invert it onto a greased wire rack., Poke the bottom of the cake with the wire tester, brush it  with some syrup, and re-invert it onto a greased wire rack., Brush the sides with the remaining syrup and allow the cake to cool completely., Store the cake for 24 hours, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap (to give the syrup a chance to  distribute evenly).  Serve at room temperature. *Note*: Tightly wrapped, the cake will keep for 3 days at room temperature, 1 week in the refrigerator, and 2 months in the freezer.]"

Cover, let stand for about one hour in a warm place. Punch down, cut the dough in half and roll it out to about a 9 inch by 18 inch rectangle. Roll it up, tuck in the ends and place in a very well lubricated ( I use crisco) glass baking dish., Repeat with the other half, and then cover with a cloth and let it rise again for about 45 minutes., Use a sharp knife to put a few slashes in the top, brush with a little beaten egg or milk, and put into a pre-heated 375 (f) oven for 30 minutes., The bread is done when an instant read thermometer reads 190 (f).]"
